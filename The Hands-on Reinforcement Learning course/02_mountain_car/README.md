This is part 2 of my course Hands-on reinforcement learning.

In this part we use SARSA to help a poor car win the battle against gravity!

### Quick setup

The easiest way to get the code working in your machine is by using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).


1. You can install Poetry with this one-liner:
    ```bash
    $ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
    ```

2. Git clone the code
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Paulescu/hands-on-rl.git 
    ```

3. Navigate to this lesson code `02_mountain_car`
    ```bash
    $ cd hands-on-rl/02_mountain_car
    ```

4. Install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml:
    ```bash
    $ poetry install
    ```

5. Activate the virtual environment
    ```bash
    $ poetry shell
    ```

6. Set PYTHONPATH and launch jupyter (jupyter-lab param may fix launch problems on some systems)
    ```bash
    $ export PYTHONPATH=".."
    $ jupyter-lab --NotebookApp.use_redirect_file=False
    ```

### Notebooks

1. [Explore the environment](notebooks/00_environment.ipynb)

3. [SARSA agent](notebooks/02_sarsa_agent.ipynb)
4. [Momentum agent](notebooks/03_momentum_agent_baseline.ipynb)
5. [Homework](notebooks/04_homework.ipynb)
